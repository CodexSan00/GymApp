# GymApp
GymApp is a self-directed learning project developed to explore software architecture and design principles through a practical implementation.
It is a gym management system designed to handle members, memberships, fees, payments, users, and user roles.

The application is built with Java, JavaFX, PostgreSQL, and JDBC, following a layered architecture that clearly separates concerns across packages.
It implements the DAO (Data Access Object) pattern for database interactions and uses the Factory pattern to centralize object creation and improve flexibility.

The main goal of this project is not only to build a functional desktop system but also to strengthen my understanding of software design patterns, clean architecture, and best practices through hands-on experience.
